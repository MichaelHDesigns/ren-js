# Gateway Website

This is the website that will be opened by [GatewayJS](https://github.com/renproject/gateway-js).


## Development

```bash
# Setup
git clone https://github.com/renproject/gateway.renproject.io
cd gateway.renproject.io
yarn install

# Start the development environment
yarn run start
```

This will run the website on <http://localhost:3000>.

To test out the different stages of the process, you can access the testing environment page at <http://localhost:3000/#/test>.

The test page has been tested to work on Chrome + Metamask.

To deploy the staging test environment to Github pages, run the `staging.sh` bash script.
